## Overview

The findwb package downloads and cleans data from the World Bank, and then
exports it into a standard rectangular format for use in the dxgap package.

## Installation

``` r
# Install the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("mikejohnpage/findwb")
```

## Development

To add data sets to the package:

1. Add a file to `data-raw/`, exporting a dataset to `data/`.
2. Update and rebuild the documentation in `R/data.R`, if required.
3. Rebuild the package.
